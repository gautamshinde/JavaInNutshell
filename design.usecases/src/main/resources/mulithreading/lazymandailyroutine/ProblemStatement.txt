A lazy man's daily routine is Eat, Drink and Sleep. If he follows Eat, Drink and Sleep activities in same order every day.
He doesn't Eat after Drink, doesn't Drink after walking up and doesn't sleep after Eat 
(Orders is always E->D->S->E->D->S)
write multi-threaded application in which Thread T1 posts the activities to Thread2 which waits for the next valid activity
and print if it receives. T2 ignores the invalid activity (activity which doesn't follow the right order)
